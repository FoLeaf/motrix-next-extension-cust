# Privacy Policy — Motrix Next Extension

**Last updated:** May 1, 2026

## Overview

Motrix Next Extension ("the Extension") is a browser extension that intercepts browser downloads and redirects them to the [Motrix Next](https://github.com/AnInsomniacy/motrix-next) desktop application for accelerated downloading via aria2.

This privacy policy explains what data the Extension accesses, how it is used, and how it is protected.

## Data Collection

**The Extension does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data with the developer or any third party.**

The Extension operates entirely on your local machine. All communication occurs exclusively between your browser and the locally running Motrix Next desktop application.

## Data Access

The Extension accesses the following data solely to perform its core functionality:

### Download Metadata

When a browser download is initiated and intercepted by the Extension, it reads:

- **Download URL** — to forward to the local Motrix Next HTTP API
- **Filename** — to display in diagnostics and pass to Motrix Next
- **HTTP Referer** — to include with the task submission when available

This data is sent only to the Motrix Next HTTP API running on `127.0.0.1` (localhost) — **never to any external server**.

### Cookies

Cookie forwarding is enabled by default and uses the required cookie and site permissions declared by the Extension:

- The Extension reads cookies for the download URL's domain
- These cookies are forwarded to the local Motrix Next HTTP API
- This enables authenticated downloads (e.g., from file hosting services that require login)
- **Cookies are never sent to any external server** — only to the locally running Motrix Next instance
- Cookies are not included in `motrixnext://` protocol fallback URLs

The user can disable cookie forwarding in Settings at any time.

### Local Storage

The Extension stores the following user-configured preferences in `chrome.storage.local`:

- RPC connection settings (port number, secret token)
- Download behavior preferences (enabled/disabled, auto-launch, cookie forwarding, download bar visibility)
- Site rules (per-domain interception settings)
- Appearance settings (theme, color scheme, language)
- Diagnostic event log (a local ring buffer of recent extension events for troubleshooting)

This data never leaves your browser and is not accessible to any external service.

## Network Communication

The Extension makes network requests **only** to the following local addresses:

- `http://127.0.0.1:{port}` — Motrix Next HTTP API
- `http://localhost:{port}` — Motrix Next HTTP API (alternative)

Where `{port}` is the user-configured API port (default: 16801).

**The Extension does not communicate with any remote servers, cloud services, analytics platforms, or third-party APIs.**

| `webRequest`                               | Read download response filename headers before delegated downloads are cancelled |
| `cookies`                                  | Forward cookies to local Motrix Next for authenticated downloads                 |
| `downloads.ui` _(optional)_                | Hide the browser download bar after interception                                 |
| `http://127.0.0.1/*`, `http://localhost/*` | Communicate with the local Motrix Next HTTP API                                  |
| `https://*/*`, `http://*/*`                | Read cookies and response filename headers for delegated downloads               |

## Third-Party Services

The Extension does not integrate with, send data to, or receive data from any third-party services. There are no analytics, telemetry, advertising, or tracking mechanisms.

## Data Retention

- **Download metadata** is used transiently during interception and is not persisted
- **User settings** remain in local storage until the user clears them or uninstalls the Extension
- **Diagnostic logs** use a fixed-size ring buffer (default 100 entries) and are automatically overwritten

## Children's Privacy

The Extension does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.

## Changes to This Policy

If this privacy policy is updated, the changes will be reflected in this document with an updated "Last updated" date. Continued use of the Extension after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
