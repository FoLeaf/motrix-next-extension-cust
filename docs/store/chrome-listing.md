Send browser downloads to Motrix Next — a modern download manager powered by aria2 for accelerated multi-threaded downloading.
```

## Detailed Description

```
Motrix Next Extension seamlessly bridges your browser with the Motrix Next desktop download manager. When you download a file, the extension automatically intercepts it and delegates the task to Motrix Next's aria2 engine — unlocking multi-threaded, resumable, and accelerated downloads.

⸻ KEY FEATURES ⸻

• Automatic Download Interception
  Captures browser downloads and routes them to aria2 for multi-threaded acceleration. Works transparently — just download as you normally would.

• Smart Filtering Pipeline
  A 5-stage filter decides what to intercept: global toggle → self-trigger guard → URL scheme check → per-site rules → document MIME guard.

• Per-Site Rules
  Add glob-pattern rules (e.g. *.github.com) to always intercept, always skip, or defer to global settings for specific domains.

• Context Menu Integration
  Right-click any link, image, audio, or video and choose "Download with Motrix Next" to send it directly to aria2.

• Magnet Link Support
  Clicks on magnet: links are automatically captured and routed to Motrix Next.

• Torrent File Handling
  Intercepted .torrent files are forwarded to aria2 for immediate BitTorrent download.

• Real-Time Dashboard
  The popup displays live download/upload speeds, active/waiting/completed task counts, and connection status.

• Cookie Forwarding (Optional)
  Grant enhanced permissions to forward session cookies to aria2 — enabling authenticated downloads from private file hosts.

• Auto-Launch
  When Motrix Next is not running, the extension can automatically launch it via the motrixnext:// protocol, wait for the RPC service to become available, then retry the download.

• Download Bar Control (Optional)
  Hide Chrome's native download shelf after a download has been intercepted, keeping your browser clean.

• Completion Notifications
  Get desktop notifications when downloads are sent to aria2 and when they finish.

• Appearance Customization
  Choose from System/Light/Dark themes and 10 Material You color schemes.

• Multi-Language Support
  Full English, Chinese (Simplified), and Japanese localization.

• Diagnostics
  Built-in event log with severity levels for troubleshooting interception issues.
